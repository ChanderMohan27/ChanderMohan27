# Hey welcome to my GitHub!

As a recent Master's of Data Science graduate, I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover impactful insights. The most exciting aspect of working with data for me is uncovering hidden patterns and relationships to build compelling stories. I am eager to bring my analytical and problem-solving skills to a professional environment, where I can contribute to meaningful projects and drive data-informed decision-making.

## My Latest work experience was with CSIRO:
-	Developed and implemented cutting-edge data augmentation methodologies for tabular data within the genetics domain, addressing an under-researched area and enhancing the depth and accuracy of genetic data analysis.
-	Worked closely with team members and stakeholders to understand the intricacies of healthcare data, conducting experiments with various techniques and machine learning models to compare and optimize performance.
-	Created end-to-end data pipelines to streamline the data processing workflow, ensuring efficient and effective handling of complex healthcare datasets from raw data to actionable insights.
-	Successfully improved model performance by 80% to 87% through the application of the Mixup Algorithm, demonstrating a significant advancement in the accuracy and reliability of genetic data analysis.

In addition, I have more than one year of experience as a Junior Machine learning Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industry.
